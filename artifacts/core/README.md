This directory contains files to build an instance of ableC extended
with this 'skeleton' extension.

This artifact may then be used on the examples in investigating how
the extension work.  It may also be used in testing that the extension
works properly - though there is no real testing to do for this silly
extension.

To build the artifact, run the script ``build.sh``, perhaps using
``source build.sh`` if ``./build.sh`` doesn't work.
